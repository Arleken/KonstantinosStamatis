# About
I have only submitted a few classes from a previous project that I have worked on. Thank you in advance for your time.

# Description
The code committed in this repository is part of a project with a strict "no 3rd-party" policy. Therefore, a lot of this code could have been replaced by popular 3rd-party libraries in projects without such restrictions.

## BadgesNetworkCalls
